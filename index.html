I have always supported first responders and public workers and will continue to do so as your Magistrate.

  <h2 class="section-title">Issues</h2>
  <p>Shelby County is a wonderful place to live, work, and raise a family.  However, there are many issues facing our community that must be addressed in order to keep us moving in the right direction.</p>

      <h3>Expand Rural Broadband Access</h3>
      <p>Broadband needs to be extended to our rural areas. Communication is key in this day and age.  When our children have SnowGo days some of them don’t even have the access necessary to complete school work assignments. A child’s education should be our top priority.</p>

      <h3>Expedite Road Projects including Fighting for Mount Eden Road Expansion</h3>
      <p>The county roads need to be fixed and expanded. When inclement weather hits the area many of these roads are completely impassable. Some people can’t even safely leave their home. We want to expand our area and make money but not at the cost of safety for our loved ones.</p>

      <h3>Invest in our Rural Infrastructure</h3>
      <p>There needs to be a better access to transportation for our lower income residents. Not all residents in this area have access to a vehicle and some have a medical condition preventing them from even leaving their home. We must come up with a way to help each other.</p>

      <h3>Invest in our healthcare system</h3>
      <p>The hospital being sold by KentuckianaOne is a major concern for our community. Our residents need access to medical care. If someone needs immediate care they will have to go to Frankfort or Louisville.  We need to ensure that Shelby county has high quality heathcare services.</p>

      <h3>Combat the Opioid Epidemic</h3>
      <p>I’d like to bring up the opioid epidemic hitting our streets. We must stop talking about these things and actually take action. Everyone loves to talk about these issues but what are we going to do about them? If elected as Magistrate I will make these issues my number one priority.</p>

      <h3>Our future</h3>
      <p>Expansion is key to the growth of our community but we must do it properly and be effective. If we don’t take these matters seriously now bigger issues will arise and it shouldn’t come at the cost of the our family, friends, and neighbors. Shelbyville truly is a gem and we have to do everything we can to preserve its charm.</p>

  quote: Ashley Snider, a good friend of mine, who works at General Electric, is out of a fine family – I worked with her grandfather, Carl Snider, and her dad, Jim Snider who retired from GE was on the Executie Board for the union hall and union steward for his maintenance department. Ashley is running for Magistrate of the 6th District and I would highly recommend her for this job.  She has a lot of energy and works hard for the causes she believes in.  She is a dedicated worker and will represent her constituents, as well as, all of Shelby County.

  quote: I am so impressed with Ashley Snider. She is a strong leader in her community, a mom, and a supporter of the workers of Shelby County and Kentucky. Her work on the Greater Louisville Central Labor Council has shown her dedication to working class citizens. Moreover, she continues her leadership abilities as COPE chairperson for the IUECWA. I met Ashley when I ran for office and I’ve continued to be inspired by her dedication to family and community. I look forward to seeing her serve Shelby County as Magistrate.
